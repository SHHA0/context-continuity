# Context Continuity

Keep long Codex tasks moving while preserving recoverable task state.

The skill is explicit-only and opt-in per conversation. Using it in one conversation never enables another conversation in the same project. Once enabled, it:

- adds one context-usage sentence to the end of every final reply;
- updates the conversation's task state once at 50% and once at 80% of each context cycle;
- refreshes task state after later user turns once 80% has been reached, until compaction starts a new cycle;
- starts a new 50%/80% cycle after detected context compaction;
- lets native compaction continue without a percentage-based hard stop; and
- creates a detailed handoff and copyable resume prompt only when the user explicitly requests one.

Task-state updates and handoffs follow the user's language. Chinese and English document templates are included. A threshold update writes `TASK_STATE.md` and `state.json`; it never creates a handoff or asks the user to switch conversations.

## Install

Requires Python 3.10+:

```text
python scripts/install.py
```

Restart Codex, then explicitly invoke `$context-continuity` in each conversation where it should run. The installer removes older managed global `AGENTS.md` blocks so other conversations are not monitored automatically. Re-running the installer is safe and preserves unrelated instructions.

Optional Stop Hook fallback:

```text
python scripts/install.py --with-hooks
```

Restart Codex, review and trust the `Stop` handler in `/hooks`, then use `doctor` to verify real event delivery. The handler checks the exact project and session ID and exits silently when that conversation did not explicitly activate the skill. It requests one short corrective continuation only for an activated conversation that omitted a threshold state update or final usage sentence. Context cycles are detected from the transcript during `final-check`; no other lifecycle Hooks are installed.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `activate --project <path> --language <tag>` | Enable this conversation and select footer language. |
| `final-check --project <path>` | Return usage, threshold-update status, and the exact footer. |
| `state-update --input <json> --project <path>` | Save the due 50%/80% task state. |
| `decision --choice yes --project <path>` | Record an explicit handoff request. |
| `state-refresh --input <json> --project <path>` | Refresh state at the exact handoff moment after reading the latest state file. |
| `handoff --project <path>` | Generate the handoff and resume prompt from the refreshed `state.json`. |
| `doctor --project <path>` | Inspect basic instructions and observed Hook events. |
| `status` | Read current usage without enabling monitoring. |

Global flags such as `--session-id`, `--codex-home`, `--transcript`, `--state-thresholds`, and `--stale-seconds` go before the subcommand.

## Saved data

```text
<project>/.context-continuity/
  <session-id>/
    monitor.json
    monitor.lock
    TASK_STATE.md
    state.json
    HANDOFF.md
    RESUME.txt
    handoff.json
  current.json
```

The session directory prevents unrelated tasks in the same project from overwriting each other. `current.json` records the newest explicitly generated handoff for compatibility and discovery; recovery prompts always identify the exact handoff path.

Existing `.avoid-context-compaction` and `.context-guard` session state remains readable. New conversations write to `.context-continuity`.

Usage is estimated from supported local JSONL snapshots. Missing or stale measurements are shown as unavailable. Basic mode relies on agent instructions; trusted Hooks improve delivery checks but cannot edit displayed replies or guarantee that every hosted tool emits lifecycle events.

```text
python -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v

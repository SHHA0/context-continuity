# Setup and verification

Run `python <skill>/scripts/install.py` to copy the skill into `CODEX_HOME/skills/context-continuity` and remove obsolete context-continuity blocks from `CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md`. Restart Codex, then explicitly invoke the skill in the intended conversation. Installation, project state, or activation in another conversation does not activate monitoring.

Session instructions ask the main agent to run `final-check` before every final reply in the invoked conversation. A due 50% or 80% update is written before the reply, then the final check is repeated. The visible reply ends with only the current usage sentence.

## Optional lifecycle Hooks

Install with `python <skill>/scripts/install.py --with-hooks`, restart, then review and explicitly trust the `Stop` handler in `/hooks`. The installer removes all other managed lifecycle handlers from older releases.

| Event | Enabled-session behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Stop | Request one short continuation when a state update or footer was omitted. |

Stop uses `decision: "block"` to request a continuation, not to cancel the task. A turn ID and `stop_hook_active` prevent correction loops. Hooks never deny tool use because of context percentage.

## Diagnose

Run `python <skill>/scripts/context_continuity.py doctor --project <absolute-project>`.

- `last_final_check` and `final_check_count` show manual checks.
- `last_state_update` and `state_update_count` show threshold saves.
- `missing_events` reports whether the Stop handler is absent.
- `observed_events` records actual lifecycle delivery.
- `automatic_monitoring: observed` requires a real `Stop` event; configuration alone is not proof.

For acceptance, verify that 49% does not request an update, 50% requests one update, repeated checks do not request another, and 80% requests the second update. After that update, a new user turn must request one rolling refresh while a repeated check in the same turn must not. Compaction starts a new cycle. Verify that even usage above 90% never denies a tool call. Defaults are state updates at 50% and 80%, with snapshots stale after 300 seconds.

The JSONL format is version-dependent. Incremental monitoring retries incomplete records. A large tool result may compact before the next observed boundary, and hosted tools may omit lifecycle events. These limits affect detection timing but never cause a percentage-based task stop.

# Context Continuity

Use native context compaction to keep work running. This skill records recoverable task state; it never stops work because of a context percentage.

## Enable once per conversation

When the user enables this skill, run:

```text
python <skill>/scripts/context_continuity.py activate --project <absolute-session-project> --language <user-language-tag>
```

Use the current `CODEX_THREAD_ID` or `CODEX_SESSION_ID`. Activation is scoped to this conversation and project. Reading or installing the skill does not activate it.

The skill is explicit-only. Never activate it because another conversation in the same project used it, because state files exist, or because the task concerns long-running work. A different conversation must invoke `$context-continuity` for itself. If `hook_setup.offer` is true, ask the labeled Hook choice once: **Configure the Stop Hook fallback? Choose: yes, show setup steps / no, use session instructions only.** The trusted `Stop` Hook only catches an omitted state update or footer. Follow the returned setup steps only when the user chooses it.

## Before every final reply

Run:

```text
python <skill>/scripts/context_continuity.py final-check --project <absolute-session-project>
```

If `state_update_due` is true, read [the task-state schema](references/checkpoints.md) and the existing `TASK_STATE.md` when present, collect factual state in the user's language, preserve still-valid earlier facts while applying later corrections, write it to a temporary JSON file, and run:

```text
python <skill>/scripts/context_continuity.py state-update --input <json-file> --project <absolute-session-project>
```

Then rerun `final-check`. Append only its nonempty `footer` verbatim as the final sentence of the reply. Do not mention threshold crossings, ask for a handoff, or pause the task because of usage.

The 50% and 80% thresholds apply once per context cycle. When usage jumps across both before a check, one 80% update satisfies both. After the 80% update, each later user turn triggers one rolling state refresh at that turn's end, keeping the pre-compaction record current. After a detected compaction, a new cycle begins and the thresholds can trigger again. State updates replace the current conversation's `TASK_STATE.md` and `state.json`; they do not create handoff files.

## Generate a handoff only on request

An explicit request from the user to generate a handoff counts as consent. Run:

```text
python <skill>/scripts/context_continuity.py decision --choice yes --project <absolute-session-project>
```

Next, locate the current conversation's `TASK_STATE.md` and `state.json`. Read both when they exist. Copy the exact `meta.saved_at` value from `state.json` into `base_state_saved_at`; use `null` only when no state file exists. Reconcile that saved state with everything that happened afterward, the current conversation, actual files, verification, running operations, and workspace state. Write a complete current snapshot using [the task-state schema](references/checkpoints.md), then run:

```text
python <skill>/scripts/context_continuity.py state-refresh --input <json-file> --project <absolute-session-project>
python <skill>/scripts/context_continuity.py handoff --project <absolute-session-project>
```

`state-refresh` rejects a stale or missing base timestamp, and `handoff` reads only the freshly written `state.json`; it does not accept a separate facts input. This captures work performed after the last 80% update. Read the generated `HANDOFF.md` and `RESUME.txt`, then provide clickable absolute links and the exact copyable resume prompt. Match the user's language. A handoff request authorizes one successful generation; a failed attempt may be retried. Never infer consent from a threshold, compaction, silence, or an unrelated request.

## Recovery and limits

After compaction, read the current conversation's `TASK_STATE.md` when needed and verify it against actual files and operation state before relying on it. When the user supplies a handoff, read that exact file and applicable `AGENTS.md`; do not select another task by recency.

Usage is the conservative `(input + output) / model_context_window` ratio from supported local snapshots. Cached input is included. Unknown or stale snapshots must be reported as unavailable. The script formats facts supplied by the model; it cannot reconstruct omitted facts, interrupt a running tool, disable compaction, or guarantee Hook delivery.
